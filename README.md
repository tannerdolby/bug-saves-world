You are the last bug left on planet Earth, the only way to make it out alive is by collecting all the stars placed throughout each level while avoiding hostile monsters and traps. Sounds easy enough right? :)

The map will feature terrains meant to test your skills as a bug. There are patches of fire around the map that will turn the bug a tint of red and result in a game over.

## Run Locally

```
npm run dev
```

## Design
All of the background objects and styles for each level in this game were created using HTML and CSS. The sprites were created with Vectornator. Have a look at the `/assets/` directory, `game-design.html` and `design.scss` for more details.

## Characters
- Playable: Ladybug
- Enemy/hostile: Bug Monster, Flames

I used HTML and CSS for designing the static assets and Vectornator for character sprites. [Design Notes on CodePen](https://codepen.io/tannerdolby/pen/vYJaZOQ)

## Inspiration
I built this game for the 2021 [GitHub Game Off](https://github.blog/2021-10-15-save-the-date-for-github-game-off-2021/) which specified a "Bug" theme. It was a really fun way to learn more about Phaser and to realize how much I enjoy game dev.
