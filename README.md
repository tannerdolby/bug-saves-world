# Bug Saves World
You are the last bug left on planet Earth, the only way to make it out (to safety) alive is to collect all the secret tokens hidden in each level. Sounds easy enough right? :)

The map will feature terrains meant to test your skills as a bug, that is crawling, jumping and sometimes flying enemy monsters that will always attack you if your in their range. 

# Have 1-3 different game levels
Featuring different background colors. And maybe monsters or map changes?

# Bugs
Ladybug - 6 limbs (very speedy, not the best at jumping)
Bee - 6 limbs (three pairs of segmented legs) + wings but the wings don't count in this game :)
