# Bug Saves The World
![really far from complete, but a demo photo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48612525/141366735-a1122516-316e-4a17-b09c-b1bea896087f.png)

You are the last bug left on planet Bugzor, the only way to make it out alive is by collecting all the secret tokens hidden throughout each level while avoiding hostile monsters. Sounds easy enough right? :)

The map will feature terrains meant to test your skills as a bug, that is crawling, jumping and sometimes flying. There are enemy monsters (bug stompers) that will always attack you if your in their range. Watch out for any secret panels or switches on the map, those 

## Design
All of the objects, characters, and styles in this game were created using HTML and CSS. Have a look at `game-design.html` and `design.scss` for how each of the things you see in game were created.

## Characters
Playable:
1. Ladybug - 6 limbs (very speedy, not the best at jumping)
2. todo: Bee - 6 limbs (three pairs of segmented legs + wings) but the wings don't count give the bee any advantage at this moment.

Enemies:
1. Bug Stompers - 2 limbs (very slow , but will deal severe damage )
2. todo: some crawly thing - like a spider

## Easter Eggs
I have added one to the first level, will fill in this section when game is closer to completion.

## Notes
For designing the characters, and game objects. I like to prototype in CodePen when creating assets for the game. I would like to use a tool more suitable for generating sprites like GIMP or something but for now, creating the game assets with HTML/CSS and taking a screenshot, then placing them on a transparent layer and loading as game objects as worked nicely.

## Inspiration
I built this game for the 2021 [GitHub Game Off](https://github.blog/2021-10-15-save-the-date-for-github-game-off-2021/) which specified a "Bug" theme. It was a really fun way to learn more about Phaser and to realize how much I enjoy game dev.
