# Bug Saves World
![really far from complete, but a demo photo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48612525/141258976-5b37794c-97fe-464c-b173-987e612afa7f.png)

You are the last bug left on planet Earth, the only way to make it out (to safety) alive is to collect all the secret tokens hidden in each level. Sounds easy enough right? :)

The map will feature terrains meant to test your skills as a bug, that is crawling, jumping and sometimes flying enemy monsters that will always attack you if your in their range.

# Design
All of the objects, characters, and styles in this game were created using HTML and CSS. Have a look at `game-design.html` and `design.scss` for how each of the things you see in game were created.

# Characters
1. Ladybug - 6 limbs (very speedy, not the best at jumping)
2. Bee - 6 limbs (three pairs of segmented legs + wings) but the wings don't count give the bee any advantage at this moment.
3. todo (add 1-2 more bugs)

# Inspiration
I built this game for the 2021 [GitHub Game Off](https://github.blog/2021-10-15-save-the-date-for-github-game-off-2021/). It was a really fun way to learn more about Phaser and to realize how much I enjoy game dev.
