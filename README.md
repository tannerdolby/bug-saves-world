# Bug Saves World
![really far from complete, but a demo photo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48612525/141366735-a1122516-316e-4a17-b09c-b1bea896087f.png)

_this is a really early demo photo of what one of the loading screens will sorta look like_

You are the last bug left on planet Earth, the only way to make it out (to safety) alive is to collect all the secret tokens hidden in each level. Sounds easy enough right? :)

The map will feature terrains meant to test your skills as a bug, that is crawling, jumping and sometimes flying enemy monsters that will always attack you if your in their range.

## Design
All of the objects, characters, and styles in this game were created using HTML and CSS. Have a look at `game-design.html` and `design.scss` for how each of the things you see in game were created.

## Characters
1. Ladybug - 6 limbs (very speedy, not the best at jumping)
2. Bee - 6 limbs (three pairs of segmented legs + wings) but the wings don't count give the bee any advantage at this moment.
3. todo (add 1-2 more bugs)

## Notes
I like to prototype in CodePen when designing things for the game. I tend to sketch out a rough idea of the game logic which I will share as well.

## Inspiration
I built this game for the 2021 [GitHub Game Off](https://github.blog/2021-10-15-save-the-date-for-github-game-off-2021/) which specified a "Bug" theme. It was a really fun way to learn more about Phaser and to realize how much I enjoy game dev.
